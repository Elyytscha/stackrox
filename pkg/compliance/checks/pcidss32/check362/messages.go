const interpretationText = `StackRox displays Kubernetes secrets and access
control information, along with their usage and types. StackRox also has
built-in policies that identify certain insecure practices, such as
distributing secrets in environment variables. Therefore, a cluster is
considered compliant if it is configured to properly restrict secret access
and these policies are enabled and enforced.`
