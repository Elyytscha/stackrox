# The following paths are written to in Central.


# CAVEAT: The below can be left for informational purposes/the off chance of StackRox being run via `docker run`.
# However, on production environments it seems that VOLUME statements alone do not guarantee a writable path in every
# case. Hence, when adding a VOLUME here, always add it to the respective deployment YAML as well.
# Additionally, mounting those directories as `emptyDir`s in Kubernetes means that they will be, well, empty on startup.
# Any directory whose contents at image creation time are relevant need to be saved using `save-dir-contents`, and then
# copied back by `restore-all-dir-contents` in the respective entrypoint scripts.

# Including these VOLUME instructions means that we can enable a
# read-only root file system without preventing writes to these paths.
# Trusted CA certificates are written to this path by `update-ca-trust`.
