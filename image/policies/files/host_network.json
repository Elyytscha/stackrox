  "name": "Ensure that the host's network namespace is not shared",
  "description": "HostNetwork controls whether the pod may use the host network namespace. Doing so gives the pod access to the loopback device and could be used to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node. It also enables a shared UTS namespace.  The UTS namespace provides isolation between two system identifiers: the hostname and the NIS domain name. It is used to set the hostname and the domain which are visible to running processes in that namespace. Processes running within containers do not typically require to know either the hostname or the domain name. The UTS namespace should therefore not be shared with the host.",
  "rationale": "Using the HostNetwork allows a container to listen to traffic on localhost.  It also shares the network namespace with the host, providing full permission for each container to change the hostname of the host. This is not in line with good security practice and should not be permitted.",
