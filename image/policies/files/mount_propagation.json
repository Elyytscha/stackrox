  "description": "Mount propagation mode allows mounting container volumes in Bidirectional, Host to Container, and None modes. Do not use Bidirectional mount propagation mode unless explicitly needed.",
  "rationale": "A Bidirectional mount is replicated at all mounts and changes made at any mount point are propagated to all other mount points. Mounting a volume in Bidirectional mode does not restrict any other container from mounting and making changes to that volume. As this is likely not a desirable option from a security standpoint, this feature should not be used unless explicitly required",
