const interpretationText = `StackRox has visibility into the authentication configuration used in your Kubernetes
cluster. Using this information we can tell if you cluster has been properly set up to enforce access control,
whether deployments have been launched with overly permissive or dangerous settings, whether cluster admin is 
appropriately scoped, and that no shared administrator users exist.`
