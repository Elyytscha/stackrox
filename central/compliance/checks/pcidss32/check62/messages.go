const interpretationText = `StackRox has visibility into the results of image
scans and the available fixes for any known vulnerabilities found in an image.
StackRox also provides the ability to run CIS Docker and Kubernetes benchmarks
which check for best practice configurations. Therefore, a cluster is compliant
if CIS Docker or CIS Kubernetes benchmarks have been run and every image scan
does not contain any CVEs with known fixes.`
