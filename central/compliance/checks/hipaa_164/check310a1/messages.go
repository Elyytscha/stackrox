const interpretationText = `StackRox allows you to leverage image scanning integration to check vulnerabilities
on all deployed or built images, as well as tracks the use of network policies in your clusters. As long as all
deployments in your cluster have network policies applied, explicitly allowing on specific traffic, and an image
scanner is also integrated, then you are considered compliant.`
