package check412

const interpretationText = `StackRox allows you to integrate with image scanners. When new vulnerabilities are discovered,
image scanners will mark images affected with the CVE, provided a scanner is integrated. StackRox provides many build, 
deploy and runtime policies that continuously monitor the system from build to runtime for best security practices. 
Therefore, a cluster is compliant if there is an image scanner in use and there are policies in place that don't allow 
deploying containers with excess privileges.`
