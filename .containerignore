# This file is the same as the .dockerignore, minus /.git/
# It is required to pass .git to the builder containers on RHTAP so we can bake build information into the binary.
# RHTAP uses Buildah which first looks up for `.containerignore`, then, if absent, - `.dockerignore`.
# Having this file enables us to have different exclusion list for RHTAP builds than in GHA.
# To regenerate, copy the contents of .dockerignore, remove /.git/ and reproduce these comments.
